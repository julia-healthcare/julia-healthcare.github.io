# About Us

We have been working in healthcare data science for over 10 years.  Our research is primarily focussed on applied studies that support decision making in the UK's National Health Service (NHS).

Julia is an exciting **young** programming language that focuses on ease of use and speed for computational data science.  We think Julia represents a fantastic opportunity for data science in health service delivery and we will curate our knowledge via this site.

Juliahealthcare.org was founded in August 2020.
