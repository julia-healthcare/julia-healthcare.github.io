# Welcome to Julia for healthcare modelling and data science

We have been working in healthcare data science research for over 10 years.  Our research is primarily focussed on **applied studies that support decision making** in the UK's National Health Service (NHS).

Julia is an exciting **young** programming language that focuses on ease of use and speed for computational data science.  We think Julia represents a fantastic opportunity for data science in health service delivery and we will curate our knowledge via this site.
