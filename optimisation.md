## Health care logistics: routing and scheduling

Many healthcare systems manage assets or workforces that they need to deploy geographically.  One example, is a community nursing team.  These are teams of highly skilled nurses that must visit patients in their own home. Another example, is patient transport services where a fleet of non-emergency ambulances pick up patients from their own home and transport them to outpatient appointments in a clinical setting.  These problems are highly complex.  For example, in the community nursing example, patients will have a variety of conditions, treatments may be time dependent (for example, insulin injections), nurses will have mixed skills and staffing will vary over time.
